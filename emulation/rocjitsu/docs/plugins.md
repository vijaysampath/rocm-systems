# rocjitsu Plugins

Execution plugins that hook into rocjitsu's simulation model. Each plugin
implements the `ExecutionPlugin` interface and receives callbacks for
wavefront dispatches, memory instructions, register reads, barriers, etc.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RaceDetectorPlugin` | `race_detector/` | Hooks memory instructions, register reads, barriers, and `s_waitcnt` to detect data races. Reports violations with disassembly traces. See [race-detector.md](race-detector.md). |
| `KernelLoggingPlugin` | `logging/` | Logs kernel dispatches and detects MMA instruction usage. |
| `ThroughputPlugin` | `throughput/` | Reports per-dispatch and aggregate wave-instruction MIPS with an exclusive instruction-family breakdown. |

The race detector plugin contains both the core detection algorithm
(`race_detector/core/`) and the rocjitsu adapter (`race_detector/plugin.h`).

### Throughput Plugin

The throughput plugin counts one instruction whenever a wavefront reaches the
before-execute hook. Counts are therefore executed **wave instructions**, not
active-lane operations. It reports one JSON object per completed dispatch and
one aggregate object at shutdown using the `rocjitsu.throughput.v2` JSONL
schema. Each object contains wall time, total wave instructions, MIPS, and an
exclusive breakdown into `scalar`, `vector`, `matrix`, `lds`, `global`,
`control`, and `other`; the family counts always sum to the total. Each family
reports `execution_seconds` measured between this plugin's before- and
after-execute callbacks, `execution_mips` using only that family-local time, and
`dispatch_mips` using the complete dispatch time. Scheduler gaps, dispatch
setup, runtime work, and time spent executing other families are not included
in `execution_seconds`. Program terminators close their interval in the
wave-halt hook because they intentionally have no after-execute callback.
When other execution plugins are enabled, their before/after hooks can fall
inside this interval depending on registration order; run `throughput` alone
when comparing family timing. The timestamps themselves are outside the
measured interval but still add observer overhead to the run.

For a summary record, `wall_seconds` is the inclusive span from the earliest
dispatch begin to the latest dispatch end, including idle gaps between
dispatches. `dispatch_seconds_sum` is the sum of completed dispatch durations.
Dispatches that never reach the execution-end callback are omitted from both
per-dispatch output and the summary.

Memory instructions take precedence over their scalar or vector encoding. The
`lds` and `global` families describe the instruction's pre-routing pipeline tag
or mnemonic fallback: `lds` covers DS/local-memory instructions, while
`global` covers global, scalar-memory, flat, buffer, image, and scratch
instructions. A later shared-aperture FLAT-to-LDS remap is therefore still
reported as `global`. Their `execution_seconds` measure synchronous instruction
execution/address generation, not later routing, deferred pipeline completion,
or stalls charged to wait instructions. Matrix includes MFMA, SMFMAC, WMMA,
and SWMMAC instructions. Control covers branches, waits, barriers, termination,
no-ops, sleeps, and delays.

For a machine-readable report:

```json
{
  "plugins": { "throughput": {} },
  "sinks": { "types": ["file"], "dir": "/tmp/rocjitsu-throughput" }
}
```

The report is written to `/tmp/rocjitsu-throughput/throughput.log`.

### Kernel Logging Plugin

The logging plugin records kernel dispatch metadata and detects MMA
(matrix multiply-accumulate) instruction usage:

- **Kernel dispatches**: entry PC, grid dimensions, workgroup dimensions,
  register counts, and kernel name (when available from the code object).
- **MMA detection**: reports the first MFMA or WMMA instruction seen in
  each dispatch.

## Enabling plugins

Plugins are compiled into standalone shared objects named
`librocjitsu_plugin_<name>.so` and discovered at runtime through the
standard dynamic-linker search path (`librocjitsu_plugin_*.so` are
installed next to the interposer, and the launcher adds that directory to
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).

A plugin is enabled by listing it in the `plugins` section of the
rocjitsu config file. The key is the plugin name (the `<name>` in
`librocjitsu_plugin_<name>.so`) and the value is a JSON object with the
plugin's configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "race": {},
    "logging": {},
    "throughput": {}
  }
}
```

The bundled plugins are `race` (`RaceDetectorPlugin`), `logging`
(`KernelLoggingPlugin`), and `throughput` (`ThroughputPlugin`).

### Enabling plugins from the mirage CLI

When launching a workload through mirage, plugins can be selected on the
command line with `--plugin <name>` instead of editing a config file.
mirage injects each selected plugin into the rocjitsu config it synthesises
for the run (and, for containerised profiles, bind-mounts the plugin's
`.so` next to the interposer). The flag is repeatable and merges with any
plugins the profile already enables:

```bash
# Enable the race detector and the kernel logger for a single run.
mirage run --plugin race --plugin logging -- ./my_app

# Same, when starting a session.
mirage session start --profile mi350x --plugin race
```

Each `--plugin` enables the plugin with its schema defaults. Plugins that
take required arguments, or runs that need custom sink settings, are
configured through a profile or an explicit `--config <file>`.

### Plugin loader boundary

Plugins are repository-owned components built and shipped with rocJitsu. The
loader boundary does not provide compatibility or versioning for independently
built plugins; the host and plugins must always be rebuilt together.

Each plugin `.so` exports three `extern "C"` functions:

- `const PluginMetadata *rocjitsu_plugin_metadata()` — returns a pointer
  to static metadata: `name` and a `config_schema` JSON string.
- `PluginHandle rocjitsu_plugin_create(const char *config_json)` —
  constructs the plugin from its resolved JSON configuration string and
  returns an opaque handle.
- `void rocjitsu_plugin_destroy(PluginHandle handle)` — destroys an
  instance previously returned by `rocjitsu_plugin_create`.

Allocation and deallocation stay on the plugin side of the boundary: the
host destroys each instance through the plugin's own
`rocjitsu_plugin_destroy` export. Use the `ROCJITSU_DEFINE_PLUGIN` macro
from `plugin_exports.h` to emit all three functions. The host validates the
required exports.

### Config schema

The `config_schema` string describes the accepted config keys. Each key
maps to an object with a `type` (`string`, `number`, or `boolean`), an
optional `description`, and an optional `default`. Keys without a
`default` are required. Example:

```json
{
  "argname": { "type": "string", "description": "does something important", "default": "defaultvalue" },
  "requiredarg": { "type": "number" }
}
```

The loader merges defaults, validates types, checks for required keys,
and passes the resolved JSON object to `rocjitsu_plugin_create`.

## Plugin output

Plugins write reports and logs through a configurable sink system rather than
directly to stderr.
This makes output testable and redirectable.

### Sink configuration

Sinks are configured from an optional top-level `sinks` object in the
rocjitsu config (the same file that lists the `plugins`). There are no
sink-related environment variables.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `types` | `["stderr"]` | Array of sink types: `stderr`, `stdout`, `file` |
| `dir` | *(none)* | Directory for file sinks. Required when `file` is in `types` |

When `file` is in `types`, each plugin writes to
`<dir>/<plugin_name>.log`. Plugin names are fixed:
`race` for `RaceDetectorPlugin`, `logging` for `KernelLoggingPlugin`, and
`throughput` for `ThroughputPlugin`.

### Examples

Interactive use — output goes to stderr (the default):

```json
{ "plugins": { "race": {} } }
```

```bash
rocjitsu --config my_config.json -- ./my_app
```

Save race reports to files (for test harnesses):

```json
{
  "plugins": { "race": {} },
  "sinks": { "types": ["file"], "dir": "/tmp/output" }
}
```

```bash
rocjitsu --config my_config.json -- ./my_app
# Race reports are in /tmp/output/race.log
```

Send output to both stderr and a file simultaneously:

```json
{
  "plugins": { "race": {} },
  "sinks": { "types": ["stderr", "file"], "dir": "/tmp/output" }
}
```

> Note: plugins can also be selected on the mirage command line with
> `mirage run --plugin <name>` (see "Enabling plugins from the mirage
> CLI" above). Sink selection is still driven entirely by the config file
> shown here.

### Writing a plugin that uses sinks

Plugins inherit a sink from `ExecutionPlugin`. Use `sink().write(msg)`
for all output instead of `fprintf(stderr, ...)` or `std::cerr`:

```cpp
class MyPlugin : public ExecutionPlugin {
public:
  explicit MyPlugin(const char *config_json) : ExecutionPlugin("myplugin") {
    (void)config_json;
  }

  void onAmdgpuDispatchPacketProcessed(const KernelDispatchInfo &info) override {
    sink().write(std::format("[myplugin] dispatch {}\n", info.dispatch_id));
  }
};
```

The sink is assigned by the `ExecutionPluginGroup` when the plugin is
added. If no group configures a sink, the default is stderr.

## How it works

The `ExecutionPlugin` interface (`execution_plugin.h`) defines hooks
that the compute unit and command processor call during execution.
Multiple plugins can be active simultaneously via `ExecutionPluginGroup`.

### VGPR observation precision

`onAmdgpuWriteVgprLanes` observes instruction-level VGPR destinations rather
than VM/runtime storage writes. Reads and writes carry the architectural lane
and byte masks for masked, sub-dword, and multi-register operands. Internal
storage operations used to preserve unaffected register state do not produce
additional architectural callbacks.

Asynchronous memory operations are modeled separately. The race detector
records their register dependencies when they are issued. A later completion
updates storage without emitting the same instruction-level write again.
Synchronization retires the corresponding outstanding operations using the
counter family captured at issue. This distinguishes legacy combined
`vmcnt`/`lgkmcnt` waits from split `loadcnt`, `storecnt`, `dscnt`, and `kmcnt`
waits on newer targets.

### Scalar register identity

`onAmdgpuReadScalarRegister` and `onAmdgpuWriteScalarRegister` carry a
`RegisterRef` whose class and index identify the architectural register. This
keeps plugins independent of encoded selector values and of the simulator's
physical storage layout. In particular, ordinary SGPRs and wave-private TTMPs
have distinct identities even though both can appear in scalar operand fields.

The older `onAmdgpuReadSgpr` hook continues to expose physical SGPR indices for
compatibility. New consumers that need architectural identity should use the
typed scalar-register hooks. Scalar writes have only the typed callback.

### Dispatch threading

Callback policy is derived from the plugins contained by an
`ExecutionPluginGroup`. An empty group returns before dispatch or locking. The
group divides hooks by frequency and synchronization cost:

- Lifecycle, dispatch, workgroup, wavefront, and barrier callbacks are
  infrequent. The group takes one recursive mutex before iterating its plugins,
  so two infrequent callbacks cannot overlap across simulation partitions. With
  the default hot-hook policy, an infrequent callback can still overlap a
  high-frequency callback. Recursive acquisition lets a callback synchronously
  read registers and fire register-observation hooks without deadlocking.
- Instruction before/after, memory-routing, and register-access callbacks are
  high-frequency and run concurrently with both other high-frequency callbacks
  and infrequent callbacks by default. Each callback is scoped to a wavefront
  below the simulation's shader-engine partition granularity. During the
  before-instruction callback, a memory instruction exposes its decoded counter
  and completion-order metadata through `amdgpu_memory_issue_info()`, before
  address or store-data operands are read.

A plugin whose high-frequency callbacks reach shared mutable state may override
`requires_serial_hot_hooks()` to return `true`. The group samples that stable
policy once when the plugin is added and then takes the same group mutex around
every high-frequency callback, serializing it with the infrequent callbacks
without a per-instruction scan of the plugin list. Plugins that protect their
own shared state should retain the parallel default.

SGPR owner resolution is skipped when no contained plugin observes scalar
register reads. Plugins that consume neither `onAmdgpuReadScalarRegister` nor
`onAmdgpuReadSgpr` should override
`observes_sgpr_reads()` to return `false`. The group samples this policy when
each plugin is added. Its conservative default is `true`, so existing plugins
continue receiving SGPR read callbacks unless they explicitly opt out.

Pass the complete sink configuration to the group constructor and add plugins
before publishing the group to simulation components. `add()` is not
thread-safe, and the group must remain immutable while callbacks may dispatch
concurrently.

## Adding a new plugin

1. Implement `ExecutionPlugin` in a new subdirectory. The plugin class
   must be constructible from `const char *config_json`.
2. Add a `plugin_export.cpp` that calls
   `ROCJITSU_DEFINE_PLUGIN(MyPlugin, "myname", schema)`.
3. In `CMakeLists.txt`, add the object library and a
   `rj_add_plugin_so(myname <object_lib> <export_src>)` call so it builds
   `librocjitsu_plugin_myname.so`.
4. Use `sink().write()` for all output — never write to stderr directly.
5. Audit shared mutable state reached by high-frequency hooks against both
   high-frequency and infrequent callbacks. Override
   `requires_serial_hot_hooks()` when that state cannot be protected within the
   plugin.
6. Override `observes_sgpr_reads()` to return `false` when the plugin does not
   consume `onAmdgpuReadSgpr`.
7. Enable it by adding `"myname": { ... }` to the `plugins` section of
   the config file.
