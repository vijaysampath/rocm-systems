/// @brief Binds a @ref simdojo::PciDevice to a VMM over the vfio-user protocol.
///
/// @details This is the only part of rocjitsu that knows libvfio-user exists. It
/// reads the bus shape a device declares, programs it into a libvfio-user
/// context, serves the socket a VMM connects to, and turns each protocol message
/// into a call on the device. In the other direction it implements the two sinks
/// a device needs, so the device can raise interrupts and reach guest memory
/// while remaining transport-agnostic.
///
/// libvfio-user is explicitly not thread safe, so every entry point into it is
/// serialized here. That matters because interrupts and guest-memory access
/// originate from whichever thread the device runs work on, while protocol
/// messages are served from the thread that called @ref
/// rocjitsu::VfioDeviceHost::run.
///
/// The serialization is reentrant on purpose. Servicing a protocol message runs
/// device hooks on the serving thread, and a device answering a doorbell write
/// by reading a command buffer and raising a completion is the ordinary case,
/// not an abuse: the library documents scatter-gather access from within a
/// device callback. What must be prevented is two *threads* in the library at
/// once, so the lock excludes other threads while allowing the serving thread to
/// re-enter.
///
/// A device can only reach guest memory the client shared mmap-ably. A window
/// that must instead be fetched by sending the client a command is refused,
/// because unless the client negotiated a second socket for those, the command
/// travels on the same connection it may itself be sending on, which the library
/// documents as known to break; whether that socket was negotiated is not
/// exposed, and the peer sends when it likes, so the collision is not confined
/// to any one thread or moment. A window the client shared as a descriptor to be
/// read with file I/O would in fact be safe, but the public API gives no way to
/// tell it apart from one needing protocol traffic, so it is declined too. In
/// practice a VMM shares guest RAM mmap-ably and the supported case is the
/// ordinary one.
///
/// A device that shares a BAR by descriptor is served to one client only. The
/// mapping outlives the connection and cannot be taken back, so a later client
/// would inherit whatever the first left behind, and the first could keep
/// reading and writing it.
///
/// Teardown has a required order, because the device holds this host through
/// raw sink pointers: stop the serving thread, join it, then destroy the host.
/// @ref rocjitsu::VfioDeviceHost::detach clears the sinks so a device that
/// outlives its transport cannot call into freed state, but it does not wait for
/// a device's own worker threads; a device with workers must quiesce them
/// before its transport is destroyed.

  ///   exception would terminate the process; this catches and reports instead,
