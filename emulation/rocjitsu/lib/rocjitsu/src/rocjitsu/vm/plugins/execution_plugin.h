/// @brief Abstract plugin interface for execution hooks.
///
/// Plugins receive callbacks at key points during simulation execution.
/// All hooks have empty default implementations so plugins only override
/// what they need. The no-plugin path has near-zero overhead (the
/// default empty group returns before locking or dispatch).
///
/// Ownership: plugins are owned by an ExecutionPluginGroup via
/// unique_ptr. The group itself is shared (via shared_ptr) between
/// the SoC and all components that fire hooks (CommandProcessor,
/// ComputeUnit, Hart). A static empty group is used as the default
/// so the plugin group pointer is never null.
///
/// Lifecycle callbacks are host-ordered, not part of the hot/infrequent hook
/// locking policy: onInit() completes before simulation callbacks begin, and
/// onShutdown() begins only after all simulation callbacks have stopped. The
/// host must enforce this ordering; lifecycle callbacks do not synchronize
/// with concurrently executing simulation hooks.
