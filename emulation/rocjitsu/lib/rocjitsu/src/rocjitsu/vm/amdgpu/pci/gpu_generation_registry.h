/// @brief The GPU generations a device model can present, and how one is chosen.
///
/// @details A generation is everything that differs between parts: which IP
/// blocks the device publishes, at which versions, with which register-base
/// segments. Selecting one used to be an equality test against a single
/// hardcoded target, which answered "is this the one part we model" rather than
/// "which part is this" -- a shape that cannot express two.
///
/// This deliberately mirrors @ref rocjitsu::IsaTargetRegistry rather than
/// inventing a second registry idiom: static descriptors validated once at
/// construction, lookup by key, no singleton and no dynamic loading. What it
/// does *not* copy is that registry's generated-header machinery, which exists
/// so separately linked images can ship different subsets of ISA targets. There
/// is no equivalent need here -- one image presents whichever part its config
/// names -- so the descriptors are a plain checked-in array.
///
/// A descriptor carries a factory rather than a built @ref IpDiscoverySpec: a
/// spec owns vectors, so it is not a literal type and could not live in a
/// constant array. That indirection is the same one @ref IsaTargetDescriptor
/// uses for its decoders, and for the same reason.
