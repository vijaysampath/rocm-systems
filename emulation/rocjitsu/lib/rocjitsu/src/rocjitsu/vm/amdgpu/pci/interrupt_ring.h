/// @details These describe the OSSSYS interrupt-handler block rather than the
/// PCI function that happens to answer its registers today. They are separate
/// from the device for that reason: the register model is being split into one
/// unit per IP block, and this is the state the interrupt block will own. A
/// consumer that wants to know what the driver said about its ring should not
/// have to include the whole device to find out.

/// follows how firmware is loaded: a driver loading firmware through the
/// security processor allocates the ring through the translation tables and
/// programs virtual addresses, and every other way of loading gets a bus
/// address. So identical register values denote different memory depending on
/// a module parameter, and an address used in the wrong space does not fail --
/// it points somewhere real and wrong.
