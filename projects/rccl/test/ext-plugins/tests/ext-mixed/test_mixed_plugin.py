Tests for the RCCL "mixed" plugin, which demonstrates the NCCL feature
"plugin system supports multiple plugin types from a single shared object".

A single librccl-mixed.so exports both a net plugin (ncclNetPlugin_vXX) and a
tuner plugin (ncclTunerPlugin_vXX). When RCCL is pointed at this object via
NCCL_NET_PLUGIN and no dedicated tuner plugin is configured, RCCL must:
  1. load the net plugin from the object, and
  2. re-use the SAME object for the tuner plugin (via ncclGetNetPluginLib),
     instead of falling back to the built-in CSV tuner.

There are two tests:
  * test_mixed_symbols_exported - static, no GPU/MPI: builds the object and
    checks both plugin symbols are exported (pytest port of plugins/mixed/example/test.sh).
  * test_mixed_runtime_load - runtime: runs a real collective and asserts from
    the RCCL debug log that net AND tuner were served from the single object.
